We don't want this to be a complicated, full featured web app
- So no database to store shit, we'll just use CSVs

Therefore, we will use flask since we don't need Django's ORM or database model

Process for Choosing an Interview:
* Interviewee applies through greenhouse
* They put in their availability in time blocks
* Check to see if greenhouse has an API
* Check to see if google calendar has an API
* Just make an application that allows you to put in a time block, and show a list of people who are available at that time
    * Based on their skill set from a spreadsheet of skills, filter whoâ€™s available who can ask frontend or backend questions
    * Also list how many times that person has been scheduled already in that week? [Stretch goal]

App Requirements:
- Allows user to choose a day and a time block (required)
- Displays who is available at that time
- Optional filters
    - Filtering by who can do certain backend or frontend questions
    - Filtering by who is on already that week (maybe only show if you have under 3 interviews that week)
        - Idk how to distinguish these from other things on calendar, maybe search for "Interview" or ask gia what naming scheme is
